## 1. Project description

__The problem__:

When marketing professionals run a campaign, they need to measure if it's profitable or not. Knowing how the different factors can affect the results, they could have a tool that supports their decisions when profiling the potential clients to expect a higher success ratio on their campaigns, which means higher profits.

__The solution__:

This project provides a classification model based on machine learning to help marketers to know if a given prospect profile has a good probability of converting into a client.
